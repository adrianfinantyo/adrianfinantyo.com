Maxima is the second largest student activity at Multimedia Nusantara University, Tangerang. This activity is intended for first year students to explore various activities and extracurricular activities on campus.

The website that was built has several features that can be used by users to provide content and connect users with the event committee through a series of activities.\r\n![Pictures of Landing Page Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/landing-page.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\n## Tech Stack\r\n\r\nThis website is built using modern web development methods, which is to separate the frontend from the backend into different stacks. On the frontend the stack used is ReactJS + Typescript, Chakra UI, Styled Components, framer motion, Material UI, and several other libraries. While on the backend the stack used is Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and MongoDB.\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n\r\nDuring this development period, I gained a lot of knowledge. Starting from building an attractive appearance, developing a website with clean code, to collaborating with other team members. Apart from website development, I have also gained experience working with the scrum methodology. With this work method, the supervisor will provide several backlogs in a kanban template and then each team member is free to take their own portion of work according to the existing deadline.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\n\r\nThe results of the website we built\r\n![Pictures of Login Page Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/login-page.jpg?raw=true)\r\n![Pictures of State Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/state.png?raw=true)\r\n![Pictures of HoME Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/home.png?raw=true)\r\n![Pictures of Dashboard Panitia Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/dashboard.png?raw=true)\r\n![Pictures of Dashboard Details Maxima 2021](https://github.com/adrianfinantyo/portofolio-post/blob/main/maxima-2021/images/dashboard-detail.png?raw=true)\r\n",
